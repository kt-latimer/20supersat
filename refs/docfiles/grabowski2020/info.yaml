abstract: "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Numerical simulations\
  \ of the impact of ultrafine cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) on deep convection\
  \ are analyzed to investigate the idea proposed by Fan et al. that addition of ultrafine\
  \ CCN to an otherwise pristine environment leads to convective invigoration. The\
  \ piggybacking methodology is applied, allowing rigorous separation of the impact\
  \ of aerosols from different flow realizations that typically occur when even a\
  \ small element of the model physics or modeling setup is changed. The setup follows\
  \ the case of daytime convective development over land based on observations during\
  \ the Large-Scale Biosphereâ€“Atmosphere (LBA) experiment in Amazonia. Overall, the\
  \ simulated impacts of ultrafine CCN are similar to the previous study by the authors\
  \ on the impact of pollution on deep convection. There is no convective invigoration\
  \ above the freezing level, but there is a small invigoration (increase in vertical\
  \ velocities) below due to the supersaturation and buoyancy differences in conditions\
  \ with additional ultrafine CCN compared to unperturbed pristine conditions. As\
  \ in the previous study, the most significant impact is on the upper-tropospheric\
  \ convective anvils that feature higher cloud fractions in conditions with ultrafine\
  \ CCN. The increase comes from purely microphysical considerations as the increased\
  \ cloud droplet concentrations from ultrafine CCN lead to increased ice crystal\
  \ concentrations and, consequently, smaller sizes and fall velocities, and longer\
  \ residence times. Mesoscale organization due to low-level shear has a small effect\
  \ on the simulated ultrafine CCN impacts. Finally, an alternative explanation of\
  \ increased lightning above oceanic shipping lines seen in satellite observations\
  \ and argued to result from convective invigoration is provided.</jats:p>"
