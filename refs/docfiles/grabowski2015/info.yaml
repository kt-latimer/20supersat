abstract: "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Two schemes for\
  \ modeling condensation in warm nonprecipitating clouds are compared. The first\
  \ one is the efficient bulk condensation scheme where cloudy volumes are always\
  \ at saturation and cloud water evaporates instantaneously to maintain saturation.\
  \ The second one is the comprehensive bin condensation scheme that predicts the\
  \ evolution of the cloud droplet spectrum and allows sub- and supersaturations in\
  \ cloudy volumes. The emphasis is on the impact of the two schemes on cloud dynamics.\
  \ Theoretical considerations show that the bulk condensation scheme provides more\
  \ buoyancy than the bin scheme, but the effect is small, with the potential density\
  \ temperature difference around 0.1 K for 1% supersaturation. The 1D advection–condensation\
  \ tests document the high-vertical-resolution requirement for the bin scheme to\
  \ resolve the cloud-base supersaturation maximum and CCN activation, which is difficult\
  \ to employ in 3D cloud simulations. Simulations of shallow convection cloud fields\
  \ are executed applying bulk and bin schemes, with the mean droplet concentrations\
  \ in the bin scheme covering a wide range, from about 5 to over 4000 cm−3. Simulations\
  \ employ the microphysical piggybacking methodology to extract impacts with high\
  \ confidence. They show that the differences in cloud fields simulated with bulk\
  \ and bin schemes come not from small differences in the condensation but from more\
  \ significant differences in the evaporation of cloud water near cloud edges as\
  \ a result of entrainment and mixing with the environment. The latter makes the\
  \ impact of cloud microphysics on simulated macroscopic cloud field properties even\
  \ more difficult to assess because of highly uncertain subgrid-scale parameterizations.</jats:p>"
