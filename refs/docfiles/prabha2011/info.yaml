abstract: "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Analysis of the\
  \ microphysical structure of deep convective clouds using in situ measurements during\
  \ the Cloud Aerosol Interaction and Precipitation Enhancement Experiment (CAIPEEX)\
  \ over the Indian peninsular region is presented. It is shown that droplet size\
  \ distributions (DSDs) in highly polluted premonsoon clouds are substantially narrower\
  \ than DSDs in less polluted monsoon clouds. High values of DSD dispersion (0.3–0.6)\
  \ and its vertical variation in the transient and monsoon clouds are related largely\
  \ to the existence of small cloud droplets with diameters less than 10 μm, which\
  \ were found at nearly all levels. This finding indicates the existence of a continuous\
  \ generation of the smallest droplets at different heights. In some cases this generation\
  \ of small droplets leads to the formation of bimodal and even multimodal DSDs.\
  \ The formation of bimodal DSDs is especially pronounced in monsoon clouds. Observational\
  \ evidence is presented to suggest that in-cloud nucleation at elevated layers is\
  \ a fundamental mechanism for producing multimodal drop size distribution in monsoon\
  \ clouds as well as in most deep convective clouds. These findings indicate that\
  \ inclusion of continued nucleation away from the cloud base into numerical models\
  \ should be considered to predict microphysics and precipitation of clouds in monsoons\
  \ and other cloud-related phenomena.</jats:p>"
