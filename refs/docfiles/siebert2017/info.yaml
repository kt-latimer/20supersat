abstract: "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>On time scales\
  \ that are long compared to the phase relaxation time, a quasi-steady supersaturation\
  \ sqs is expected to exist in clouds. On shorter time scales, however, turbulent\
  \ fluctuations of temperature and water vapor concentration should generate fluctuations\
  \ in supersaturation. The variability of temperature, water vapor, and supersaturation\
  \ has been measured in situ with submeter resolution in warm, continental, shallow\
  \ cumulus clouds. Several cumuli with horizontal extents of order 100 m were sampled\
  \ during their first appearance and development to depths of ~100 m in a growing\
  \ boundary layer. Fluctuations of the saturation ratio are observed to be approximately\
  \ normally distributed with standard deviations on the order of 1%. This variability\
  \ is almost one order of magnitude larger than sqs calculated using simultaneous\
  \ measurements of the vertical velocity component and the droplet size distribution.\
  \ It is argued that, depending on the ratio of the phase relaxation and the turbulent\
  \ mixing time, substantial fluctuations in the supersaturation field can exist on\
  \ small spatial scales, centered on sqs for the mean state. The observations also\
  \ suggest that, on larger scales, fluctuations of the supersaturation field are\
  \ damped by cloud droplet growth. Droplets with diameters of up to 20 μm were observed\
  \ in the shallow cumulus clouds, whereas the adiabatic diameter was less than 10\
  \ μm. Such large droplets may be explained by a few droplets experiencing the highest\
  \ observed supersaturations for a certain time. Consequences for aerosol activation\
  \ and droplet size dispersion in a highly fluctuating supersaturation field are\
  \ briefly discussed.</jats:p>"
